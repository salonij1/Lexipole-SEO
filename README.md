# Lexipole-SEO/PPC
SEO and PPC Optimisation
This project was entirely based on benchmarking and SEO optimization strategies for a police training academy i.e., Lexipole. Benchmark against the top competitors mentioned in the client interview provided in the project rubric, Usability testing of client website and analyzing their social media and one other “free form” idea.
Based on the benchmarking ideas and SEO strategy, I also created a wireframe of the website to help engagement and converstion (course enrollment). Teh goal for teh compnay was to increase enrollmet for individual training courses.
